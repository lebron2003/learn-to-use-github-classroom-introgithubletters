Learning to use GitHub
Each of you will be given a letter.  You must create a graphical representation of the letter you have been given and place 
your code in "Letters" Python file.
You will learn how GitHub merges your code and place it in the correct spot, when completed properly using PyCharm integration.
Have fun and created something spectacular!
